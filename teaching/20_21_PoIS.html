         The course will cover the major classical, as well as the modern, information security protocol. It is designed to help students understand how information security protocols are designed on paper, and how they work in reality. The course is especially useful for students who plan to do research and/or product development in the areas of cybersecurity and information privacy. Some key topics covered in the course are:
         <ul style="background-color: inherit; margin-top: -10px;">
         <li>Cryptography and cryptanalysis</li>
         <li>Block and stream ciphers</li>
         <li>Hash functions</li>
         <li>Key exchange</li>
         <li>Digital certificates and PKI</li>
         <li>Oblivious transfer</li>
         <li>Byzantine agreement</li>
         <li>Cryptography in noisy channels</li>
         PS: Course content may vary depending on the interest and response from the students.

 <h3>Group project:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         Each group (group size to be decided) will work on one paper related to cybersecurity or privacy. Select a paper published in the last two years from a top security and/or privacy conference. Prepare a self-explanatory Beamer presentation (10-15 slides) and a LaTeX report (single-column, 10pts). The report should contain: (1) a summary of the paper (max 2 pages); major critiques on assumptions, technical approach, analysis, or results (no page limit); and suggestions for improvements/extensions (no page limit).
      </p>

   <h3>Policies:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">

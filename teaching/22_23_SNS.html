   <h3>Course content:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         The course will cover the principles of computer systems and network security. It is designed to help the students understand various attack and defense techniques. The course is especially useful for students who plan to do research and/or product development in the area of system building. Some key topics covered in the course are:
         <ul style="background-color: inherit; margin-top: -10px;">
         <li>Fundamentals of cryptography</li>
         <li>Operating system security</li>
         <li>Network attacks and defenses</li>
         <li>Web security models</li>
         <li>Smartphone security architectures</li>
         <li>Microarchitecture security</li>
         <li>Sandboxing</li>
         <li>Vulnerability analysis techniques</li>
         <li>Privacy and censorship</li>
         <li>Social engineering attacks</li>

 <h3>Group project:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         Each group (group size to be decided) will work on one research paper related to systems and/or network security. Select a paper published in the last two years from a top security conference. Prepare a LaTeX report (single-column, 10pts; <a href="https://ciaoankit.github.io/files/Template_LaTeX_Rep.zip" class="blue">template</a>) and a self-explanatory Beamer presentation (max 20 slides; <a href="https://ciaoankit.github.io/files/Template_Beamer_Pres.zip" class="blue">template</a>). The report should contain: (1) a summary of the paper (max 2 pages); (2) major critiques on assumptions, technical approach, analysis, and/or results (no page limit); and (3) suggestions for improvements/extensions (no page limit).
      </p>

 <!--
 <h3>Group project 2:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         Each group (group size to be decided) will work on one programming/applied project. Implement a security vulnerability/exploit/attack (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS) in a programming language of your choice. Then, update the code to defend against the implemented attack. Or, a demonstration of an exploit against a real-world computer application is also accepted provided that its fix is furnished. Submit a single zip file that contains: (1) source code; (2) screenshots of code execution; and (3) clear instructions (in <i>README.txt</i>) to set up environment (if any) and execute the code. No report is required.
      </p>
   -->

   <h3>Policies:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         Do and submit your original work only. Cheating, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty will carry consequences.
      </p>

   <h3>Textbook and references:</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">
         There is no single textbook that can cover the entire course material. Nevertheless, some good references to start are given below; most of them are available on the Internet.
